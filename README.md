## **Brenda Ariho — Cloud Portfolio Documentation**

A project-backed introduction to my journey into cloud engineering.

---

## 👋 Hi, I’m Brenda — Welcome to My Cloud Portfolio

Breaking into cloud engineering can feel overwhelming when you're new — no job experience, no certifications yet, just determination. This is proof to myself (and future employers) that I can *build real solutions*, not just understand theory.

So I built a set of hands-on projects that show exactly what I can do right now:


✔️ Deploy applications on AWS
✔️ Design architectures that scale
✔️ Work with serverless and databases
✔️ Solve real problems with clean, simple solutions


This portfolio represents weeks of practice, learning, mistakes, debugging, and growth — all shared here.

# 📂 **My Cloud Projects**

Below is an overview of all four projects in my cloud portfolio. Each one targets a different AWS skillset and solves a specific problem.

---

# 🚀 **1. Ecommerce Traffic Spikes Architecture (AWS VPC + ALB + ASG + RDS)**

### ⭐ What This Project Is

A scalable, fault-tolerant architecture designed to help an ecommerce site survive heavy traffic during promotions and product launches.

### 💡 Why I Built It

Most outages happen during high traffic moments. I wanted to learn how real companies prevent downtime.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
* Application Load Balancer
* Auto Scaling Group + Launch Template
* EC2
* RDS PostgreSQL
* CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms
* IAM
* S3 for hosting the architecture diagram

### 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

* Network design
* Infrastructure scalability
* Security boundaries
* Monitoring and troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced

* Breaking down a huge architecture into understandable steps
* Fixing IAM permission issues
* Debugging route table pathways
* Understanding ALB health checks
* Setting up ASG scaling policies without confusion

# 🎨 **2. Static Art Portfolio Website (S3 Hosting)**

### ⭐ What This Project Is

A beautiful, lightweight art portfolio website showing art work — hosted completely on S3 as a static site.

### 💡 Why I Built It

I wanted to combine my creativity with my cloud skills and show that I can deploy front-end projects on AWS confidently.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* S3 Static Website Hosting
* HTML / CSS
* Image Optimization
* Bucket Permissions (IAM + Public ACLs)
* GitHub Version Control

### 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

* Cloud hosting
* Static web deployment
* Folder structure management
* Debugging broken assets and links

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced

* Fixing broken paths and missing images
* Correcting bucket permissions
* Understanding how S3 handles hosting and public access
* Making the UI feel clean and intentional

---

# 💬 **3. Serverless Customer Feedback API (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)**

### ⭐ What This Project Is

A fully serverless API that allows users to submit feedback. The API stores each feedback entry in DynamoDB via Lambda.

### 💡 Why I Built It

Serverless is one of the most in-demand AWS skills. I wanted to show I understand how services communicate without servers.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* AWS Lambda (Python)
* API Gateway (REST API)
* DynamoDB
* IAM Roles & Policies
* CloudWatch Logs
* JSON event testing
* Postman (API testing)

### 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

* Serverless development
* Event-driven architecture
* API design
* DynamoDB data modeling

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced

* Handler naming issues (“index.handler” vs file names)
* DynamoDB writes failing due to IAM
* Debugging using CloudWatch logs
* Understanding how synchronous vs asynchronous Lambda tests behave
* Building confidence in troubleshooting instead of guessing

---

# 📘 **4. AWS Restart Question Bank (S3 + JS + JSON)**

### ⭐ What This Project Is

A practice site for AWS learners in Uganda who need simple, accessible questions with explanations and analogies.

### 💡 Why I Built It

Access to quality beginner-friendly AWS resources isn’t widely available and free. So I built something people could use immediately.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* S3 Static Website Hosting
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* JSON for the question bank
* IAM for secure hosting
* GitHub for version control

### 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

* Frontend development
* Data structuring
* Cloud hosting
* Lightweight interactive design

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced

* Creating a clean question–answer flow
* Structuring JSON logically
* Debugging broken paths in S3
* Making the UI simple enough for beginners

# 🧭 **How These Projects Fit Together**

Together, these projects show:

| Skill Area                    | Demonstrated Through          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Cloud Architecture**        | Ecommerce Spikes Project      |
| **Serverless & Databases**    | Feedback API                  |
| **Static Hosting & Frontend** | Art Portfolio + Question Bank |
| **Networking & Security**     | VPC, IAM, Routing             |
| **Monitoring**                | CloudWatch + ASG              |
| **Troubleshooting**           | All projects                  |

This proves I understand cloud beyond theory — I can build, break, fix, and improve real systems.

# 🌱 **What I’m Working on Next**

To deepen my expertise, I’m currently exploring:

* CloudFront + S3 for global static distribution
* API authentication (Cognito)
* GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
* Revisiting Lambda + DynamoDB with more patterns
