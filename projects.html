      <h2>E-Commerce Traffic Spikes (AWS Autoscaling Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A scalable, high-availability AWS architecture designed to handle real-world e-commerce traffic spikes.</p>
      <p>When online stores experience sudden traffic surges during sales and product launches, websites crash or slow down. I built a fully elastic AWS architecture using a custom VPC, EC2 Auto Scaling, an Application Load Balancer, and RDS to show how e-commerce platforms can stay fast and reliable even under unpredictable load.</p>
      
      <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
      <img src="images/EcomArchitecture.png" alt="Ecom Diagram" class="diagram">
      
      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>AWS VPC | EC2 | AutoScaling | Load Balancer | RDS | CloudWatch | IAM | Route53</li>
       </ul>

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>My Ecommerce Spikes project is a simple backend service I built to understand how ecommerce systems work under the hood: storing orders, retrieving product data, and handling requests like a real API.</p>
       
        <ul>
           <li>I designed and built the backend using:</li>

           <li>AWS Lambda for running the logic</li>

           <li>API Gateway for the routes</li>

           <li>DynamoDB for storing the data</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>This project helped me understand how real ecommerce apps scale without servers, how to handle data efficiently, and how modern cloud-native apps are structured.</p>

      <h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Finding the right architecture as a beginner</li>
        <p>At first, I wasn’t sure how to structure a cloud-based ecommerce spike. I had to test multiple options, read documentation, and simplify the design so it made sense to me.</p>

        <li>Understanding IAM permissions</li>
        <p>This project taught me how sensitive AWS permissions are. A single missing permission caused failures, so I learned to read logs, test policies, and troubleshoot calmly.</p>

        <li>Breaking the project into small steps</li>
        <p>Ecommerce feels huge, but I learned that if I break a project into tiny pieces — static content, a backend flow, data storage — everything becomes achievable.</p>

        <li>Handling errors and learning to debug</li>
        <p>Misconfigured permissions and routing issues forced me to slow down and analyze errors rather than panic. This improved my problem-solving mindset.</p>
        
      </ul>

      
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This project demonstrates cloud architecture skills—scalability, fault tolerance, and cost-efficient resource management—mirroring the same patterns used in production e-commerce environments.</p>

      <h2>Static Art Portfolio Website (S3 Hosting Project)</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A fully static art portfolio website hosted on Amazon S3.</p>
      <p>I designed and deployed a simple static website to showcase art and graphic design work. The site loads instantly, works across all devices, and uses AWS S3 static hosting for low-cost, high-durability storage.</p>
   
      <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
      <img src="images/Gallery.PNG" alt="S3 Website" class="diagram">

      <h3>Services Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS S3 | HTML | CSS | GitHub</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Created and configured S3 bucket for static hosting</li>
        <li>Uploaded HTML/CSS files</li>
        <li>Set correct bucket policy + CORS rules</li>
        <li>Enabled versioning and logging</li>
        <li>Linked custom domain using Route 53</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixing broken links and image paths</li>
        <p>My images didn’t show at first, so I learned how relative paths work and how folder structure affects a website.</p>
        <li>Understanding how versioning and re-uploads work</li>
        <p>Every change required me to re-upload files. This taught me to manage versions carefully and test each update.</p>
        <li>Deploying with S3 when things didn’t load</li>
        <p>At first, my pages weren’t displaying correctly. I had to understand bucket hosting, public access settings, index documents, and MIME types.</p>
        
      </ul>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This project strengthened my static hosting and frontend fundamentals, proving I can deploy lightweight websites on AWS with proper structure, design, and accessibility.</p>

      <h2>Customer Feedback API (Serverless Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A serverless API that collects customer feedback and stores it securely in DynamoDB.</p>
      <p>Many small businesses lack a lightweight backend system for collecting feedback without running servers. I built a fully serverless API that receives user input, validates it, and stores it in a DynamoDB table for analysis.</p>
      
      <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
      <img src="images/api.png" alt="API Diagram" class="diagram">

      <h3>Services Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS API Gateway | Lambda(Python) | DynamoDB | IAM | CloudWatch | JSON</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Story</h3>


      <p>Every great product needs feedback — and this project taught me how to collect it the cloud-native way.

      I built a serverless Customer Feedback API that lets users send feedback, which is then stored in DynamoDB.

      This was my chance to learn how real companies build backends that:</p>

      <ul>
      
         <li>Accept incoming requests</li>

         <li>Validate data</li>

         <li>Write to a database</li>

         <li>Scale automatically</li>

         <li>Stay cost-efficient</li>

      <p>I used:</p>
      <ul>

         <li>AWS Lambda for the compute</li>

         <li>API Gateway for the endpoint</li>

         <li>DynamoDB for storage</li>

         <li>IAM for secure access</li>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DynamoDB permissions and IAM troubleshooting</li>
        <p>This was my biggest challenge. My Lambda function ran successfully but didn’t write to the table. I had to troubleshoot IAM roles, policies, and execution logs.</p>
        <li>Testing with both synchronous and asynchronous invocations</li>
        <p>Synchronous tests failed at first. This forced me to think like a developer and debug step-by-step instead of guessing.</p>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This project demonstrates modern backend development—serverless, event-driven, scalable, and cost-efficient. No servers, no maintenance, and instantly ready for integration with any frontend.</p>

      <h2>AWS Restart Question Bank (S3 Website + JavaScript App)</h2>
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A lightweight practice tool that helps AWS Restart learners study foundational AWS concepts using simple explanations and analogies.</p>
      <p>Many AWS Restart trainees in Uganda lack free, accessible study tools for AWS Restart. I created a static practice site powered by JSON, JavaScript, and S3 hosting to make revision easier.</p>
      
      <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
      <img src="images/qb.PNG" alt="QB Website" class="diagram">

      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS S3 | IAM | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | JSON | Git | GitHub</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>When I was studying cloud, I noticed one thing:</p>
      <p>Most beginners struggle not because AWS is hard, but because the explanations online are too complicated.</p>
      <p>So I created something I wish I had when I started — a simple website with AWS foundational questions explained in plain language, with analogies.</p>
      <p>I built it for learners in Uganda who may not have access to pricey resources — something lightweight, accessible on any device, and free.</p>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Organizing large sets of questions and designing a clean structure for easy navigation.</p>
      <p>I had to figure out how to load questions, show answers, and format JSON — all with simple JS.</p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>Well-structured revision resource for AWS Restart learners.</p>
      <p>It can be expanded with search, categories, scoring, and eventually DynamoDB.</p>
